::*******************************************************************************
::* CONTENTS:
::  Runs a runVimTests self-test and compares the test output with previously
::  captured nominal output.
::  The command-line arguments to runVimTests and the test file are embedded in
::  the captured output filename and are extracted automatically:
::  testrun.suite-1-v.log ->
::	$ runVimTests -1 -v testrun.suite > /tmp/testrun.suite-1-v.log 2>&1
::  The special name "testdir" represents all tests in the directory (i.e. '.'):
::  testdir-1-v.log ->
::	$ runVimTests -1 -v . > /tmp/testdir-1-v.log 2>&1
::
::* REMARKS:
::
::* DEPENDENCIES:
::  - GNU sed, diff available through %PATH% or 'unix.cmd' script.

::* REVISION	DATE		REMARKS
::	007	25-Apr-2013	Adapt the added special _vimtestinfo Vim
::				argument.
::	006	28-Feb-2011	XXX: Locale setting doesn't work with gnuwin32
::				tools (sort 5.3.0), use case-insensitive diffing
::				as a workaround.
::				Add difference exposed by the new Windows error
::				message on test dir without any tests: On
::				Windows, the file glob error message uses
::				backslashes.
::	005	28-May-2009	Pin down locale to get reproducible sorting order.
::	004	12-Mar-2009	Also capturing stderr output, e.g. for "test not
::				found" errors.
::				ENH: Fixing Windows differences in the Vim
::				invocation by making substitutions in the
::				captured log.
::	003	07-Mar-2009	The test file (suite) is now also embedded in
::				the captured output name so that multiple test
::				files and suites can be captured.
::	002	25-Feb-2009	Command-line arguments are now embedded in the
::				captured output filename and extracted
::				automatically.
::	001	11-Feb-2009	file creation

:fixWindowsDifferencesInLog
:: There are a couple of differences in the Vim invocation between Windows and
:: Linux. To avoid that these always show up in the diff, we perform some
:: substitutions in the line that logs the Vim invocation to make the captured
:: Windows log look like the old log.(Which I always create on Unix, because the
:: Windows diff is able to handle files with different line endings
:: transparently.)
:: - Don't include the invocation of "runVimTestsSetup.vim", as it contains its
::   absolute path, which would make the test run unreproducible on different
::   systems.
:: - In the Windows shell, all Vim arguments must be enclosed in double quotes,
::   but the Unix shell script uses single quotes where possible (except for
::   --cmd "let g:runVimTests='...'").
:: - The file glob error message uses backslashes.
:: - The path and name of the special .vimtestinfo file is different.
